# Booking Request App (PowerApps Project)
## Introduction
Contoso Pet Boarding is a local pet boarding facility and veterinary care practice. Lately, customers have requested a way to submit booking requests for pet boarding without having to call the office. They would like to create an app that allows customers to submit the information for their booking request for the office to review. They would like customers to be alerted when their booking request has been received and approved or rejected. 

## Solution Overview
They want to build an app that allows them to capture these booking requests and decide to accept or decline the booking.
## What was done:
- Created custom tables and columns in Dataverse
- Buillt a Power Apps canvas app that takes user input and creates rows in your custom table
- Buillt Power Automate cloud flows to send notifications when new rows are created in your table
